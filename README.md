# APB-Protocol-based-Memory-Interface-Design-and-Verification-
Implements an AMBA APB slave module with support for up to 16 slave devices , enabling aligned 32-bit read/write operations with byte strobe , ready , and error  signaling. Verified using a SystemVerilog class-based testbench with constrained-random stimulus, mailbox communication, and a bus functional model and a Interface block.
